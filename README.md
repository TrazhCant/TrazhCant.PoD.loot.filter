# TrazhCant.PoD.loot.filter

This filter is currently under construction.  It is aimed to minimize the screen clutter, and any customizations are kept minimal to avoid re-cluttering the screen.
It is intended for players that make it to Nightmare or beyond in PoD for their first time and quickly find themselves sick of the incessant loot clutter.
As such, if you want giant bars to click on for desirable items (e.g. high runes) that drop in game so you have an edge over other players scrambling to snatch it up first,  you won't find that here.
